# Readme
This project uses both R and Julia to wrangle datasets into a single dataset called
VKT.
<br/>
The master codes contain all the code used by R and Julia to produce the final dataset.
<br/>
Ideally both will succeed because the data is already avaliable but if starting by stages,
then consideration to which cells in each code needs to run before continuing.
<br/>
This project may be extended to include steps to run the code at a later stage.


# R Code
The R code is used to wrangle the dataset and create RDA files.

# Julia Code
The Julia code mostly takes RDA files, produces graphs and a CSV file.
